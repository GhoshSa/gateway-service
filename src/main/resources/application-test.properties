# --- General Spring Boot Test Configuration ---
# Disable banner for cleaner test output in console
spring.main.banner-mode=off

# --- Self-Healing Scheduler Intervals (Shortened for Tests) ---
# These properties control the frequency and behavior of your HealthCheckScheduler.
# Setting them to low values ensures your tests run quickly.

# Interval for health checks (in seconds)
# A value of 2 seconds means health checks will be triggered every 2 seconds.
gateway.self-healing.health-check.interval-seconds=2

# Timeout for individual health check requests (in seconds)
# How long to wait for a response from a service's health endpoint.
gateway.self-healing.health-check.timeout-seconds=1

# Number of retries before marking an instance as truly unhealthy.
# Setting to 1 means it will check once, fail, then retry once. If that also fails, it's unhealthy.
# This makes unhealthy detection faster for tests.
gateway.self-healing.health-check.retry-count=1

# --- Failure Prediction Configuration (if enabled in your app) ---
# Ensure prediction is enabled if your scheduler logic relies on it.
gateway.self-healing.prediction.enabled=true

# Interval for failure prediction tasks (in seconds)
# Similar to health checks, a low value speeds up testing of prediction logic.
gateway.self-healing.prediction.prediction-interval-seconds=3
